**Tutorial: Training a ResNet18 for Image Classification Using Transfer Learning**

This tutorial shows how to train a ResNet18 model for image classification using transfer learning. Transfer learning is a technique where a model trained on one task is used as the starting point for a model on a second related task. This can save time and resources compared to training a model from scratch and can also improve the performance of the new model.

**Two Major Transfer Learning Scenarios**

There are two major transfer learning scenarios:

* **Finetuning the ConvNet:** In this scenario, the entire pre-trained network is used as a starting point and the weights of all layers are updated during training. This is the most common approach and is typically used when the new task is very similar to the task that the model was pre-trained on.
* **ConvNet as fixed feature extractor:** In this scenario, the weights of all layers except the last fully connected layer are frozen. This means that the features learned by the pre-trained network are used, but the model does not learn any new features from the new dataset. This approach is typically used when the new task is different from the task that the model was pre-trained on.

**For this tutorial, we will be using the finetuning approach.**

**Steps**

The following steps show how to train a ResNet18 model for image classification using transfer learning:

1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Load a pre-trained ResNet18 model.
3. Update the number of classes in the model to match the number of classes in your dataset.
4. Create a `torch.optim.Optimizer` object to train the model.
5. Define a loss function.
6. Start the training loop:
    * Forward pass the image through the model to get the predictions.
    * Calculate the loss.
    * Backward pass the loss to update the model parameters.
7. Evaluate the model on the test set.

**Conclusion**

This tutorial has shown how to train a ResNet18 model for image classification using transfer learning. Transfer learning is a powerful technique that can be used to save time and resources and improve the performance of deep learning models.
